**SVAR React Core** is a lightweight, fast, and mobile-friendly React component library that offers 20+ reusable, pre-styled UI components. It includes form controls, popups, date & time pickers, toast notifications, and more. All components are customizable, support light and dark themes, and come with full TypeScript support. 

The library is fully compatible with React 18 and 19.

Along with the **Core** library, you can use the following SVAR React components to build a unified app interface:

- [Menu](https://github.com/svar-widgets/react-menu) - create basic menu bar, actions or context menu;
- [Toolbar](https://github.com/svar-widgets/react-toolbar) - create button and icon panels with configurable, responsive layouts;
- [Tasklist](https://github.com/svar-widgets/react-tasklist) - basic to-do list component to add, edit, check or delete tasks;
- [Comments](https://github.com/svar-widgets/react-comments) - nice-looking comments section with bubbles or flow views;
- [File uploader](https://github.com/svar-widgets/react-uploader) - simple file uploader component.

### :hammer_and_wrench: How to Use

To start using the components from the **Core** package, simply import the package and include the desired component in your React file:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@svar-ui/react-core";
import "@svar-ui/react-core/all.css";

const myComponent => (<Button>Click me</Button>);
```

See the [getting started guide](https://docs.svar.dev/react/core/getting_started/) to quickly set up and begin using SVAR Core components in your React projects.
